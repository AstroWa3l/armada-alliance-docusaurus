# How to delegate ADA

:::info Before we start
* See this link for an explanation on delegation:  [**https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/**](https://cardano.org/stake-pool-delegation/)
* You always maintain full control of your ADA in your own wallet when you delegate.
:::
The first step to delegating your ADA is to download one of the official Cardano wallets.

## Cardano Wallets

Yoroi is a light mobile wallet available for Android and Apple devices as well as browser extension. 

Daedalus is not a mobile wallet but a full node wallet.
